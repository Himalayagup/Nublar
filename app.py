# Import all the page modules here to make them available in the application
# By importing them, you can make the routes available for your server to use.

# Example Pages Module 1 - This would contain the routes for the first set of pages
#import example_app.pages  # Importing page module for general pages like homepage, about, etc.

# Example Pages Module 2 - This might contain routes for another set of pages
# import example_app.pages_2  # Importing another page module for more specific routes

# Cookie Pages Module - This would contain routes for handling cookies
# import example_app.cookie_pages  # Importing cookie-related routes like setting, getting, and deleting cookies

# Now, all the routes defined in these modules will be available for use in the server.
# You just need to uncomment this block of code if you want to activate the routes and view the pages.
